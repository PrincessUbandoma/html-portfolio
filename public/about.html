<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Princess Ubandoma, an enthusiastic and quick-learning professional currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Business with Informatics at FH SÃ¼dwestfalen. With a passion for web development, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other digital tools through both academic coursework and hands-on experience..</p>

<h1>My Journey</h1>
<p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work. This curiosity turned into a passion when I started exploring online resources and tutorials to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I was fascinated by how lines of code could transform into interactive and visually appealing websites.

  Eager to expand my knowledge, I enrolled in several online courses and participated in coding bootcamps. These experiences provided me with a strong foundation in front-end development and introduced me to JavaScript, which opened up a new world of possibilities for creating dynamic web applications.
  
  In addition to self-study, I have been working as a student IT software support at FP Digital Business Solutions since March 2022. In this role, I offer remote customer support for software solutions, create user-friendly guides for help pages, draft detailed documentation to streamline work processes, and assist the support team with various tasks, including ticket processing via email and phone.
  
  Previously, I gained valuable experience as a sales assistant at Studietemps, where I advised customers on products, handled transactions, and prepared the store for new promotions.</p>
